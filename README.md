### Branching Strategy:
Each repo will have 2 branches namely main and develop.

main indicates the working project
develop indicates that development is currently taking place.
After a branch under develop is completed and tested, it will then be merged into the main branch.

### .gitignore files
The .gitignore files will indicate which files will be ignored when files are uploaded to the repo. Files that will be ignored are ones that contain sensitive data. This will apply for all the projects.

### Credentials and sensitive info storage:
This information will be added to .gitignore list and will be stored in a separate file and will not be included in the reposotry, unless it is needed.
